- *We* or *Us* are the author(s) of this software.
- *You* are the user(s) of this software.

> This is free software. We will never charge you to use, license, or obtain this software.
Doing so would make us a cunt.

> We will never take down or start charging for what is available today. 
Doing so would make us a cunt.

> You may use this software for whatever you want, everything EXCEPT Illegal or Military are OK! 
("this software" means verything contained within in this project, unless specified otherwise)
Limiting how you can use free software would make us a cunt.
But using our free code to create SkyNet would make you a cunt.

> We offer no warranty on anything, ever. We've tried to make sure that the software won't erase your hard drive, but it might happen. We're sorry. 
However, we warned you, so you can't sue us. Suing people over free software would make you a cunt.

> If you find bugs, it would be nice if you let us know so we can fix them. 
You don't have to, but not doing so would make you a cunt.

> Speaking of bugs, We are not obligated to fix anything nor are we obligated to add a feature for you. 
Feeling entitled about free software would make you a cunt.

> If you add a new feature or fix a bug, it would be nice if you contributed it back to this project. 
You don't have to, but not doing so would make you a cunt. 
The repository you obtained this software from should contain a way for you to contact me. Contributing to open source makes you awesome!

> If you use large portions of this software/code you should keep this license in place, or credit us.
You don't have to, but not doing so would make you a cunt.

> If you became a millionare from something that uses this software, it would be nice if you bought us a drink
You don't have to, but not doing so would make you a rich cunt.

> If you use this software/code in small portions you don't have to give us any credit, but it would still be nice.

Enjoy your free software and don't be a cunt! 
Bye!
